# Bamazon
## An Amazon-like storefront
Bamazon is an online store where customers can buy a variety of products. By utilizing MySQL, JavaScript, and Node.js, it allows customers to see a complete list of products with current stock quantities. It prompts the customers what product and how many they can purchase.
